# Atoms-D
Visualisation of atoms with Bohr's model
Please do not distribute without proper credit to SpiritSabre
Note that this visualisation is not completely accurate as it 1. Uses an outdated model of the atom, 2. Uses disproportionate sizes of subatomic particles and 3. Does not factor in other environmental changes
Enjoy!
